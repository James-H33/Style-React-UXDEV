# How to Style in React and Not Lose Friends

Aside from the presidential election last year, I don't know of another topic sure to cause more heated debate than how to style React components. This workshop will cover the main methods for styling in React. Through live code examples we will discover the pros and cons of each method and make recommendations based on your projects unique needs. By the end you should feel confident that there is hope! You can style React components without losing friends.

Fork this repo and refactor the CSS to use the BEM naming convention.

#Part Two - Sass
[This link will take you to a starter React SPA in Codepen.](http://codepen.io/sarrahvesselov/pen/JELRXL/) This repo has Sass installed for you.

#Part Three - Inline Styles
[This link will take you to a starter React SPA in Codepen.](http://codepen.io/sarrahvesselov/pen/XpgZzz/) This is the same pen we used in Part One. We will slowly start replacing the CSS with inline style objects.

Fork this repo and fill out the rest of the styles using inline javascript.
